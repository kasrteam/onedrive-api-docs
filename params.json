OneDrive API makes it easy to connect your app\r\nto your user's files across **Office 365** and access the advanced functionality of\r\nfiles in OneDrive and SharePoint.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, we recommend using a supported [OneDrive SDK](sdks.md) in\r\nyour application. However, you can code your application directly to the HTTP\r\nendpoints if your preferred language/platform is unavailable.\r\n\r\nOneDrive API is also a part of the [Microsoft Graph](http://graph.microsoft.io).\r\nMicrosoft Graph makes it easy to connect with data from many Office 365 services\r\nusing a single API end point.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nTo quickly get started connecting your app to OneDrive or SharePoint document\r\nlibraries, check out the SDK or getting started guide for your platform:\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n[**Windows / .NET**][sdk-csharp] |\r\n[**Apple iOS**][sdk-ios] |\r\n[**Android**][sdk-android] |\r\n[**Python**][sdk-python] |\r\n[**HTTP**](getting-started.md)\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe OneDrive API exposes two major resource types:\r\n\r\n* [Drive](#drive-resource) _(top-level object)_\r\n* [Item](#item-resource) _(files, folders, and so on.)_\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of an item resource.\r\n\r\n<!-- {\"blockType\": \"example\", \"@odata.type\": \"oneDrive.item\", \"truncated\": true, \"name\": \"item-example\"} -->\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"@content.downloadUrl\":\"http://public-sn3302.files.1drv.com/y2pcT7OaUEExF7EHOlpTjCE55mIUoiX7H3sx1ff6I-nP35XUTBqZlnkh9FJhWb_pf9sZ7LEpEchvDznIbQig0hWBeidpwFkOqSKCwQylisarN6T0ecAeMvantizBUzM2PA1\",\r\n  \"createdDateTime\": \"2014-10-31T03:37:04.72Z\",\r\n  \"cTag\": \"aYzpENDY0OEYwNkM5MUQ5RDNEITU0OTI3LjI1Ng\",\r\n  \"eTag\": \"aRDQ2NDhGMDZDOTFEOUQzRCE1NDkyNy4w\",\r\n  \"id\":\"D4648F06C91D9D3D!54927\",\r\n  \"lastModifiedBy\": {\r\n    \"user\": {\r\n      \"displayName\": \"daron spektor\",\r\n      \"id\": \"d4648f06c91d9d3d\"\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"name\":\"BritishShorthair.jpg\",\r\n  \"size\":35212,\r\n  \"image\":{\r\n    \"height\":398,\r\n    \"width\":273\r\n  },\r\n  \"file\": {\r\n    \"hashes\":{\r\n      \"crc32Hash\":\"omY5NA==\",\r\n      \"sha1Hash\":\"wmgPQ6jrSeMX7JP1XmstQEGM2fc=\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"mimeType\":\"image/jpeg\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResources expose data in three different ways:\r\n\r\n* _Properties_ (like **id** and **name**) expose simple values.\r\n* _Facets_ (like **file** and **photo**) expose complex values. The presence of\r\n  **file** or **folder** facets indicates behaviors and properties of an item.\r\n* _References_ (like **children**) point to collections of other resources.\r\n\r\nYou can expand references in your URL with the _expand_ query parameter, for example,\r\n`?expand=children`. Request specific properties and facets with the\r\n_select_ query parameter, for example, `?select=id,name`. By default, most properties\r\nand facets are returned while all references are hidden. For efficiency, we\r\nrecommend that you specify _select_ and _expand_ for the data you care about.\r\n\r\nFor details about resources and facets, see [Resources](resources/resources.md)\r\nand [Facets](facets/facets.md).\r\n\r\n### OneDrive API root resources\r\n\r\nUse these root API resources to access an item or drive.\r\n\r\n| Path                                                | Resource                                                              |\r\n|:----------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| [`/drive`](drives/default.md)                       | User's default [Drive](#drive-resource).                              |\r\n| [`/drives`](drives/list-drives.md)                  | List [Drives](#drive-resource) available to the authenticated user.   |\r\n| [`/drives/{drive-id}`](drives/get.md)               | Access a specific [Drive](#drive-resource) by its ID.                 |\r\n| [`/drives/{drive-id}/root/children`](items/list.md) | List items in the root of a specific [Drive](#drive-resource).        |\r\n| [`/drive/items/{item-id}`](items/get.md)            | Access an [Item](#item-resource) by its ID.                           |\r\n| [`/drive/special/{special-id}`](items/special_folders.md) | Access a [special (named) folder](items/special_folders.md) by its known name.  |\r\n| [`/shares/{share-id}`](shares/shares.md)            | Access an [Item](#item-resource) by its **shareId** or a sharing URL. |\r\n\r\n\r\nItems can also be addressed by path, by putting a colon after any item\r\nor drive URL, and following it with the relative path to the item. The next\r\ntable shows how to use a colon in the URL address. You might optionally\r\ntransition back to addressing the resource model by putting another\r\ncolon at the end. Ensure your request follows the\r\n[path encoding](misc/path-encoding.md) requirements.  \r\n\r\n| Path                                             | Resource                                                               |\r\n|:-------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `/drive/root:/path/to/file`                      | Access an [Item](#item-resource) by path under the root.               |\r\n| `/drive/items/{item-id}:/path/to/file`           | Access an [Item](#item-resource) by its path relative to another item. |\r\n| `/drive/root:/path/to/file:/children`            | List children when accessing by path relative to the drive root.       |\r\n| `/drive/items/{item-id}:/path/to/file:/children` | List children when accessing by path relative to another item.         |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Drive resource\r\n\r\nThe [Drive resource][drive-resource] is the top level object within a user's\r\nOneDrive or a SharePoint document library. Nearly all API accesses will\r\nstart by addressing a drive resource.\r\n\r\n### Item resource\r\n\r\n[Items][item-resource] are the objects inside the OneDrive file system. They\r\ncan be accessed by their `id` using the `/items/{item-id}` syntax, or by their\r\nfile system path using the `/drive/root:/path/to/file` syntax.\r\n\r\nItems have [Facets](facets/facets.md) that provide data about their identities and\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\nFolders act as containers of items, and have a `children` reference pointing to\r\na collection of items under the folder.\r\n\r\n### Shared folders and remote items\r\n\r\nOn OneDrive Personal users can add one or more shared items from another drive\r\nto their OneDrive. These shared items appear as an item in the `children` collection\r\nwith a [remoteItem facet](facets/remoteitem_facet.md).\r\n\r\nFor more information on working with shared folders and remote items, see\r\n[Remote items and shared folders](misc/working-with-links.md).\r\n\r\n### Sharing and permissions\r\n\r\nOne of the most common actions for OneDrive and SharePoint is sharing content\r\nwith other people. OneDrive API allows your app to create\r\n[sharing links](items/sharing_createLink.md), [add permissions, and send invitations](items/invite.md)\r\nto items stored in a drive.\r\n\r\nOneDrive API also provides a way for your app to [access shared content](shares/shares.md)\r\ndirectly from the sharing link.\r\n\r\nFor more details on how to share and consume shared content, see\r\n[Sharing items in OneDrive API](items/sharing.md).\r\n\r\n## Webhooks and notifications\r\n\r\n[OneDrive supports sending webhook-style push notifications](webhooks/webhooks.md)\r\nwhen the contents of a OneDrive is changed. Your app can use these notifications to track changes\r\nin near real-time instead of polling the server for changes.\r\n\r\n## Programming notes\r\n\r\n### API Compatibility\r\nThe OneDrive API will continue to evolve and gain additional functionality. The API\r\nincludes a version number as part of the URL path, to ensure that we can make\r\nbreaking changes to the API without impacting existing implementations. Breaking\r\nchanges will be made by incrementing\r\nthe version number in the URL, for calls that work differently than before.\r\n\r\nWe define a breaking change as a change in the format of a request or response\r\nthat removes an existing documented behavior, or alters an existing documented behavior.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the API will expose additional undocumented features from\r\ntime to time. These features should not be depended on until they are documented.\r\nDo not assume that current behavior that deviates from the documentation will persist.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to make non-breaking changes to the existing version of the API,\r\nincluding adding facets, properties, and resources to the API. As such, any code\r\ncalling the OneDrive API needs to:\r\n\r\n* Be resilient to additional properties being added to JSON responses. Ignoring them is OK.\r\n* Have no dependency on the order of properties returned in JSON responses.\r\n* Use documented API paths, resources, properties, and enumerated values only.\r\n  Non-documented values are not guaranteed to remain consistent.\r\n\r\n### Throttling\r\nOneDrive has limits in place to make sure that individuals and apps do not\r\nadversely affect the experience of other users. When an activity exceeds OneDrive's\r\nlimits, API requests will be rejected for a period of time. OneDrive may also\r\nreturn a *Retry-After* header with the number of seconds your app should wait\r\nbefore sending more requests.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests  \r\nRetry-After: 3600\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Working with OneNote Notebooks\r\n\r\n**Note:** Although OneDrive stores OneNote notebooks, you shouldn't use the\r\nOneDrive API to work with OneNote notebooks. Instead, use the\r\n[OneNote API](http://dev.onenote.com).\r\n\r\n### OData v4 compatibility\r\nThis API supports OData V4 at the [minimum conformance level](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/os/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-os-part1-protocol.html#_Toc372793759).\r\nSome of the features of the OneDrive API might not\r\nbe available via the OData metadata or generated content. For more information, see\r\n[OData Support](odata/odata-support.md).\r\n\r\n## Continuous documentation validation\r\n\r\nAs part of our commitment to high quality documentation, we've developed a process\r\nthrough which the samples and examples in our documentation are tested for validity\r\nas part of every check-in. We call this continuous documentation validation.\r\n\r\nEach time a change to our documentation is made, we validate that everything works\r\nas documented in the service. When we create a new build of the service, we validate\r\nthat the examples in our documentation also continue to work. This helps us ensure\r\nthat everything we document works and works as expected even as new updates\r\nare made available.\r\n\r\nFor the latest build details, check out the [AppVeyor build status page for our documentation repository](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs).\r\n\r\n## Related topics\r\n\r\nThe following topics contain high level overviews of other concepts that apply\r\nto the OneDrive API.\r\n\r\n* [Authentication and sign in](auth/readme.md)\r\n* [Addressing resources](misc/addressing.md)\r\n* [Case sensitivity](misc/case-sensitivity.md)\r\n* [Error responses](misc/errors.md)\r\n* [HTTP verb tunneling](misc/verb-tunneling.md)\r\n* [Terms of use](terms-of-use.md)\r\n\r\n[drive-default]: drives/default.md\r\n[drive-resource]: resources/drive.md\r\n[item-resource]: resources/item.md\r\n[drive-get]: drives/get.md\r\n[item-changes]: items/view_delta.md\r\n[item-search]: items/search.md\r\n[item-children]: items/list.md\r\n[permission-resource]: resources/permission.md\r\n[item-get]: items/get.md\r\n[sdk-csharp]: http://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-csharp\r\n[sdk-ios]: https://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-ios\r\n[sdk-android]: https://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-android\r\n[sdk-python]: https://github.com/onedrive/onedrive-sdk-python\r\n\r\n<!-- {\r\n  \"type\": \"#page.annotation\",\r\n  \"description\": \"Getting started programming with the OneDrive REST API\",\r\n  \"keywords\": \"getting started onedrive rest api programming C# ios android rest http\",\r\n  \"section\": \"documentation\",\r\n  \"tocPath\": \"Getting Started\",\r\n  \"tocIndex\": -100\r\n} -->\r\n",
